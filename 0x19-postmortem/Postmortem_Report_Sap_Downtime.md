### Issue Summary
On Feb 15, 20235 from 09:23 to 14:45 EAT, the TechPak Industries internal SAP server experienced a critical outage. Approximately 85% of users were unable to access the SAP system, with the remaining users experiencing severe performance degradation (response times exceeding 30 seconds). The root cause was identified as disk space exhaustion on the primary database server due to uncontrolled growth of transaction logs combined with scheduled heavy financial month-end reports executing simultaneously.

### Timeline
- **09:23** - First automated monitoring alert triggered for SAP application response time exceeding threshold
- **09:31** - Secondary alert received for database server disk space reaching critical level (95% utilization)
- **09:40** - IT Operations team initiated investigation, initially focused on network connectivity issues
- **10:05** - System automatically restarted, temporarily restoring service before degrading again
- **10:25** - Initial investigation of network infrastructure found no issues, focus shifted to database performance
- **11:10** - Issue escalated to Database Administration team after discovering critical disk space shortage
- **11:45** - Misleading path taken investigating potential database corruption, consuming valuable time
- **12:30** - Root cause identified as transaction log growth combined with heavy report processing
- **13:15** - Emergency maintenance window declared to implement resolution
- **14:45** - Issue resolved and system stability confirmed with full service restoration

### Root Cause and Resolution
The outage was caused by a confluence of three factors: excessive transaction log growth, scheduled month-end financial reports executing simultaneously, and insufficient disk space monitoring. The SAP database server had accumulated transaction logs over the past 45 days without proper archiving, consuming 65% of available disk space. When multiple department heads initiated resource-intensive month-end reports concurrently, the remaining disk space was rapidly exhausted by temporary processing files and additional transaction logs.

Resolution was implemented by first stopping non-essential report processing jobs, then performing an emergency archiving of transaction logs to free critical space. The database configuration was adjusted to properly manage log file growth, and the most resource-intensive reports were rescheduled to execute sequentially rather than in parallel.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
#### Areas for Improvement
Disk space monitoring and alerting
Transaction log management
Report scheduling processes
System resource allocation
Incident response procedures

#### Specific Action Items
Implement tiered disk space alerting at 75%, 85%, and 95% thresholds with increased urgency
Configure automated transaction log archiving on a 7-day retention schedule
Develop report scheduling system to prevent concurrent execution of resource-intensive processes
Increase database server disk capacity by 2TB to accommodate growth
Create dedicated filesystem for transaction logs with appropriate monitoring
Review and optimize top 10 resource-intensive reports to reduce execution time
Implement resource governance limiting concurrent heavy report execution
Document updated incident response procedures with clear escalation paths
Establish monthly maintenance window for database optimization
Train end users on staggering report execution during month-end closing periods
This incident highlights the need for improved monitoring, resource management, and scheduled maintenance procedures to prevent similar outages in the future.
